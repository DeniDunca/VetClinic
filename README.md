# VetClinic-Proiectare_Software
The project “Veterinary Clinic” is a full stack application that represents a useful way
for pet owners to program veterinary appointments and for doctors to stay organize with their
work. The project is made in principle using Java and SpringBoot on backend, React Js on
frontend and MySQL for the data base, also the testing part is made in Intellij with Mock
annotation, and the data base connection test is made with Postman.
